# Immediate Window

The Immediate Window folder contains a copy of the Immediate Window asset by StagPoint previously avaible for free on the Asset Store. It is based on StagPoint.Eval, a live expression evaluation library, itself derived from the dfScriptLite library by Daikon Forge but adapted to AOT platforms like iOS.

StagPoint's website is now defunct (domain is parked), so these are the latest Web Archive before the pages went under maintenance before being completely removed:

The LICENSE in this folder takes precedence over any LICENSE in the upper hierarchy.
