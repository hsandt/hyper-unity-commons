# Immediate Window

It is based on StagPoint.Eval, a live expression evaluation library, itself derived from the dfScriptLite library by Daikon Forge but adapted to AOT platforms like iOS.

StagPoint's website is still active although they ceased support and other activities, you can read more there:
